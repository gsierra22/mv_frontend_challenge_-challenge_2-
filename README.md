## Installation
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm install react-bootstrap` (for some reason the app can not compile if this is not installed)
-Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`
-I have also deployed the app to heroku at this link: https://redux-to-do-lis.herokuapp.com/

## To Do List

In this simple App I user can view a list of tasks they need to complete, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete them afterwards. I remade this app in react from it's original version using JQuery. The original can be viewed at the following link: https://github.com/gsierra22/weekend-sql-to-do-list. I eventually remade it using express and postgresSQL. It can be view here: https://github.com/gsierra22/to-do-list-updated . This is my third time making it and this time it usuallys react-redux in order to save and modify data.

### Technologies

Javascript,
CSS,
HTML,
Boostrap,
React,
Redux,
Heroku

### Issues
For some reason the app requires running npm install react-bootstrap. It had difficulty compiling when I made the app. I also tried installing a drag and drop feature on this app but I kept getting the error spec.type must be defined in react-dnd. I tried looking online for a solution and following videos. I have decided that I will attempt a drag and drop on a different app. Overall I enjoyed this and thought it was a good way to refresh on redux.
